#Final Project Ideas:

Here’s a running tally of ideas for final projects that you might adopt, hack, or just use as grist for the mill. I’ve created a folder online where I’ve added lots of relevant cites and will tag them with your first names to guide you to relevant sources. Feel free to add to the list below:

1. Building on the group project mining the U of NCs database of slave narratives, analyze the way enslaved Americans related to literacy. You might find Hager’s work helpful here to contextualize the work. You might also think of including some data: some quantitative analysis of how many times certain keywords appear in the text, changes in the relative emphasis on literacy (or on particular aspects of literacy, like reading, writing, publishing) over time, etc.
1. Following an thread from Julia's blog post, looking at inscription and pedagogy. Julia mentioned that the "resegregation" of schools (lamentably, NYC is a leader here) is compounded by the divide between those who are taught to read/write/publish and those who are figured as mere receptacles for information and discipline. Various projects could be imagined here: historical (looking at the "vocational" v. "liberal" education debate from the early 1900s; looking at today's debates around the Common Core and high-stakes testing; looking at theories of pedagogy (Friere, Dewey, bell hooks).

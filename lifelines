## Lifelines	

Part of your grade in this course depends on your periodically showing something a bit "extra." You know that friend who always crushes bar trivia? Who effortlessly remembers who featured in what classic film? You, too, can be them, at least for a day.

At the start of each class, I'll ask who would like to serve as my "lifelines" for the day. The term comes from the cheesy, hugely popular gameshow from the 2000s, "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" Contestants answered trivia questions and, when stumped, could poll the audience or make a phone call to a trusted friend, their "lifeline."

When that pall of silence falls over the class, my "lifelines" will perk up. They will have read carefully, reviewed the study questions, and absolutely/positively have something to say. Will they know the "answer"? Maybe not. Reading the kinds of critically, formally, and theoretically dense texts we English types wrestle with is much tougher [than WWTBAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_K0IQp3Fg), trust me. But they will be our "experts" for the day, ready to jump in and take the tough questions.

Refer to your contracts for the number of "lifeline" days you're expected to contribute. You don't need to sign up in advance, but be ready to volunteer when I ask. And avoid procrastinating, since it's a mess when X number of students are all trying to serve as lifelines in the last several sessions.
